ic-01 - Welcome to GitHub 

## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to learn about Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages. You will need to understand each of these in order to complete your assignments for this class. 

## Instructions

1. If you are unfamiliar with Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages, please start by reviewing the background material provided below in the Resources section.  

1. Make sure you have an RSA key set up for your GitHub account. Step-by-step instructions are [here] (https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys) -- be sure to start by checking for an existing SSH key. **You must set up your RSA key with a password.** If you do not, you will lose push/pull access to your repo. 

1. Clone this repo using SSH. 

1. In your local copy of the repo, open index.html in your favorite text editor (if you do not have a favorite, we recommend the free version of [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)) and replace "----Add you name here----" with your name. 

1. Push your change to your remote repo. 

1. From your remote repo, create a GitHub Page for your repo. Step-by-step instructions are [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart), **start on step 3**.  

1. In the local copy of your repo, Add the link to your GitHub Page **HERE**. 

1. Push your change to your remote repo. 

1. See below for submission instructions.

### Git and GitHub

Git is a **distributed Version Control System (VCS)**, which means it is a useful tool for easily tracking changes to your code, collaborating, and sharing. With Git you can track the changes you make to your project so you always have a record of what you’ve worked on and can easily revert back to an older version if need be. It also makes working with others easier—groups of people can work together on the same project and merge their changes into one final source!

GitHub is a way to use the same power of Git all online with an easy-to-use interface. It’s used across the software world and beyond to collaborate and maintain the history of projects.

### GitHub Vocabulary and Flow 

The following are common terms you will hear with respect to using GitHub. 

#### Repositories

A repository is where your project work happens--think of it as your project folder. It contains all of your project’s files and revision history.  You can work within a repository alone or invite others to collaborate with you on those files. Repositories are stored in the could. You need to clone them (see below) to work on a local copy. 

#### Cloning 

You must clone a repository to create a local copy on your computer. When you do this, Git is what you will use to sync yours cope of your repository with the copy stored in the could. It is important to clone repositories in order to modify their contents because it better enables collaboration, version tracking, and allows you to use the text editor of your choosing to write your programs. When you clone a repository your local version pulls down all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project.   

For step-by-step instructions on cloning a repository, see this resource: ["Cloning a Repository"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository). 
 

#### Committing and Pushing

**Committing** and **pushing** are how you can add the changes you made on your local machine to your remote repository in the cloud. This is how your instructor and/or teammates will be able to see your latest work when you’re ready to share it. It is recommended that you make a committ to your remote repository anytime you make major changes in your code. If you do this, you will have version of your code that you can revert back to if anything breaks in the future. 

When you attempt to make a commit you will first need to "add" all changes in your local repository to the Git staging area. After that, you will commit these changed, and then push them to your remote repository. Detailed instructions can be found here:

* [push](https://github.com/git-guides/git-push)

#### Collaborating with Others

One of the most useful parts of Git is that it helps you collaborate on code with other people. The way this is best achieved is through **branches**. When a repository is created, the default branch is called the main branch. After cloning the repository, if you are working with others (or yourself), it is common to create a "branch" on which you can develop specific changes. Once you are pleased with your changes, you place a **pull request** to merge the changes from your branch into the main branch. This allows you to isolate changes and only incorporate them into your main code once they are complete.

#### GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages gives you the option to host a website directly from a GitHub repo. We will use GitHub Pages to grade your assignments throughout this course. In other words, **when you are asked to do a coding assignment, your final submission will be graded based on what shows on your GitHub Pages webpage**. 

**You will lose points on assignments if you do not create a GitHub Page for us to grade**. 

For more information on creating GitHub Pages, see the ["Creating you site"](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site) section of this link.
